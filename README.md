# Space Race Analysis (Start to 2020) üöÄ

## Introduction üåå

This data analysis project explores the history of the space race, the beginning of the space age to the year 2020. 
The project utilizes data visualization techniques to present insights into the space race, successful and failed missions, and who are leaders in the space industries. The Analysis also provides insights on private organizations which are contributing towards the success of the space exploration.

## Project Highlights üéØ

- **Data Cleaning**: The data provided was cleaned and prepared for analysis to ensure that the analysis provided correct results.

- **Data Visualization**: The project employs data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to create informative charts, graphs, and maps and give a better understanding of how the space race evolved over time.

- **Insights**: Interpretations and insights are derived from the data to understand the contributions of different countries and organizations to space exploration.

## Data Sources üìä

- This dataset was scraped from [nextspaceflight.com] and includes all the space missions since the beginning of Space Race between the USA and the Soviet Union in 1957.

## Tools and Libraries üõ†Ô∏è

- Python for data analysis and visualization.

- Jupyter Notebook for code development and documentation.

- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

- Matplotlib, Plotly and Seaborn for data visualization.

## Conclusion üå†

- **Prices**: Over the course of space exploration history, prices have exhibited a consistent downward trajectory, attributable to a confluence of factors such as rapid technological advancements, heightened competition, increased commercialization, more efficient operational practices, government initiatives, innovation, and the invaluable lessons gleaned from past failures.
- **Rocket Launches**: In the initial stages of space exploration, the space industry was largely dominated by the fierce rivalry between the USSR and the USA, a rivalry that persisted throughout the Cold War until its conclusion in 1991. In the contemporary era, we witness a dynamic landscape where the United States, China, Japan, India, and Russia emerge as the prominent players in the ongoing global endeavor of space exploration.
- **Mission Failures**:Throughout the entire span of space exploration history to the present day, mission failures have been a recurring aspect of the journey. This trend can be attributed to a multitude of factors, including the entrance of new participants into the market and the stabilization of missions by established leaders. Additionally, the continuous march of technological progress and the ability to draw invaluable insights from past failures have collectively contributed to a reduction in the frequency and impact of mission setbacks.
